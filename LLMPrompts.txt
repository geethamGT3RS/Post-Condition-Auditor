How can I generate the postconditions for a python function using the Chain of thought prompting strategy?, I need the post conditions in a JSON format with Description and their corresponding assert statements. Also, should I also send the function Description here?,In my project, I need to get the response from one prompt posted to gemini and then need to post another prompt to the model to properly format the output to a JSON. What is the best way to do this. This needs to be done iteratively for multiple prompts,I am going with option 2 as I need the model to "Think" before it structures the output to a format that Python can use to test the postcondition.. What will be the best design pattern?
